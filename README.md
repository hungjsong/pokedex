# Pokédex

## Description
##### This project is a WIP with focus on functionality first and styling coming later.
This project aims to allow users to search for and view Pokédex entries, create their own Pokémon teams, and utilize the Pokemon catching simulator.

Users are able to search for Pokemon and view their Pokedex entries by entering either their name or their Pokedex number. Details shown include the Pokemon's name, Pokedex number, category/genus, its type(s), and its height and weight.

The team builder lets users create a plan to help assemble a Pokemon team of their liking. For each Pokemon users can select the Pokemon, what item it holds, if it is shiny, what level it is, its happiness, its nature, its EV (efforts values) and IV (individual values) point distributions, its gender, and their move set.

The catching simulator lets users simulate the catching of wild Pokemon. The chances of catching a wild Pokemon is influenced by various factors such as the time of day, the type of Poke Ball used, how the Pokemon was encountered, the Pokemon's inherent catch rate, if the Pokemon is suffering from a status effect, etc. The simulator lets users tweak these factors to their liking and see how it affects each Poke Ball's catch rates with the table of Poke Balls below. When the encounter is started, users can select a Poke Ball and throw until the Pokemon is captured or run away to return to the settings page.
